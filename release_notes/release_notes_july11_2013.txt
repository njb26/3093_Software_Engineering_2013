Comments:
1. The following is missing in the specs. document.

"Create a table in the specification document that includes the release name and number, release date, the percentage of tests passed/failed and the code coverage."

2.  Complete camera feature.
3. Try grid view for stock photos. If possible, get text overlay to work. 
4. Add comments (preferably, javadoc compatible) to all code. This is important. 
5. Try to at least 2 code reviews (one per member) for each release, and work together. 
6. Continue writing test cases. Update the table (mentioned in [1]) for this release and the upcoming release.

Good job on the existing test plan and all features that you've so far. I look forward to seeing more tests and "close-to-complete" features.
