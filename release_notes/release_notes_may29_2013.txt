In this release:

REQUIREMENTS DOC:
-Our suggestion was to create a new name for the app, we could not
find one that we liked more than the current "Meme My Friends"
and as this is relatively low-priority, did not update, and will
continue to think on this

SPECIFICATIONS DOC:
-Added in the first version of the use-case diagram
-Added first version of system metaphor
-Added in user story for this release


APPLICATION:
-Created two basic activities, the first one and the one
that you use if you choose to load a photograph rather than
take a photograph
-Decided on basic layout, font, buttons, and so on to understand
what  we would need to continue and have a uniform layout/app'


TODO:
For the next release:
-We want to have the activity to select stock photos
created, with perhaps some stock photos to choose from.
-The activity to select photos from the phone's gallery created
	-actually selecting photo is a nice-to-have

If we have time: have the "camera" activity working, to take a photo
	-nice-to-have: saving the photo to the system.
