Requirements Document:
1. Include timeline and milestones for each phase (under scope)
2. "Terminology" section missing!
3. "InstaMeme" sounds good. 

Specification Document:
1. User stories are important!! Update them.

Next steps:
1. Have images load from the gallery or stock photos.
2. Write unit test cases for modules you have implemented so far (use user stories to identify test scenarios). 
3. Henceforth, Write unit test cases before you implement a module/scenario (specifically, for UI bugs that you currently have)
4. Include comments in javadoc style to all java source files (This is mandatory!)
4. Include comments (document) .xml files. 

Good job on documenting non-functional requirements. Keep up the good work!

P.S: Why is the formatting in release notes (word wrapping) messed up? Is it because of the branch-merge issue?
