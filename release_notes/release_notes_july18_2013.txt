NOTE: Always remember to check-in release notes

Comments:
1. The following is still missing in the specs. document.

"Create a table in the specification document that includes the release name and number, release date, the percentage of tests passed/failed and the code coverage."

2. Add ability to save pictures from the camera (complete all features related to the camera)
3. Add ability to save text overlay on pictures.
4. Add captions to pics in the stock.
5. Write new, simple raw unit test cases for new features

Good job on getting the camera and text overlay to work!
